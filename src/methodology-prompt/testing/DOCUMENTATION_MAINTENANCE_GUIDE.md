# Documentation Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This guide provides specific instructions for maintaining the contextual documentation files. It defines the thinking process, standards, and practical steps needed to keep documentation valuable for future sessions.

## The Documentation Maintenance Mindset

### **Core Question Framework**

Before making any changes, future sessions should ask:

**1. Context Questions:**
- What problem am I solving?
- Why is this approach better than what existed before?
- What alternatives did I consider and why did I reject them?
- What constraints or requirements are driving this decision?

**2. Learning Questions:**
- What did I learn about the system during this change?
- What assumptions turned out to be wrong?
- What worked better or worse than expected?
- What would I do differently if starting fresh?

**3. Future Questions:**
- How will this decision affect future development?
- What should future developers know to extend this properly?
- What mistakes should future developers avoid?
- What patterns should be replicated?

**4. Documentation Questions:**
- Which documentation files need updates?
- What context would help future sessions understand this decision?
- How does this connect to existing documented decisions?
- What guidance should I provide for similar future decisions?

## Practical Update Workflow

### **Step-by-Step Update Process**

**1. Preparation Phase**
```
Before making changes:
□ Read existing documentation to understand current state
□ Identify which files will need updates
□ Note connections to existing decisions
□ Prepare context about why changes are needed
```

**2. Decision Documentation Phase**
```
While making changes:
□ Document alternatives considered
□ Record rationale for choices made
□ Note what works well vs. what's challenging
□ Capture insights about the system
```

**3. Update Phase**
```
After implementing changes:
□ Update TESTING_APPROACH_RATIONALE.md with decisions
□ Update TESTING_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md with new principles
□ Update EVOLUTIONARY_INSIGHTS.md with learnings
□ Ensure updates connect to existing documentation
```

**4. Quality Validation Phase**
```
Before committing:
□ Check updates provide clear context for future sessions
□ Verify updates explain WHY, not just WHAT
□ Ensure updates include alternatives and rationale
□ Confirm updates provide future guidance
□ Validate updates maintain documentation consistency
```

### **Time Investment Guidelines**

**Documentation Time Budget:**
- **Small Changes** (bug fixes, minor enhancements): 10-15 minutes
- **Medium Changes** (new features, refactoring): 30-45 minutes  
- **Large Changes** (architectural changes, major features): 60-90 minutes

**Time Allocation:**
- 40% - Understanding current documentation state
- 30% - Documenting decision context and rationale
- 20% - Capturing learnings and insights
- 10% - Quality validation and consistency checking

### **Documentation Health Checks**

**Monthly Health Check:**

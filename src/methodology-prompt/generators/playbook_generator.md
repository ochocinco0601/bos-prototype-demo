# Step 6: Business Impact Playbook Generator

## Objective
Automatically generate a comprehensive Business Impact Playbook using the data collected from Steps 1-5, creating an actionable incident response and business impact communication document.

## Generation Process

### Prerequisites
- Steps 1-5 completed with minimum 80% completeness
- All stakeholders identified with expectations
- Business impacts analyzed with measurements
- Signals defined with thresholds and ownership

### Playbook Template Structure

```markdown
# Business Impact Playbook: [BUSINESS_PROCESS_NAME]

## Executive Summary
[Auto-generated business context and critical information]

## Stakeholder Impact Matrix
[Table of stakeholders, expectations, and impact scenarios]

## Impact Scenarios & Response Procedures
[Priority-ranked scenarios with specific response procedures]

## Signal Definitions & Thresholds
[Actionable signals with clear response triggers]

## Escalation Matrix
[Escalation paths and communication templates]

## Appendices
[Supporting data and technical details]
```

## Generation Logic

### Executive Summary Generation
```
Input: Steps 1-5 data
Output: Business context summary

Logic:
1. Extract business process name and description
2. Identify top 3 critical stakeholders
3. Summarize highest-priority impact scenarios
4. List key business metrics and KPIs
5. Provide business context for non-technical stakeholders

Template:
"The [BUSINESS_PROCESS] supports [KEY_STAKEHOLDERS] by [BUSINESS_PURPOSE]. 
Failure impacts [PRIORITY_IMPACTS] with [MEASUREMENT_METHODS]. 
Critical signals: [TOP_3_SIGNALS] owned by [SIGNAL_OWNERS]."
```

### Stakeholder Impact Matrix Generation
```
Input: Steps 1-2 stakeholder and dependency data
Output: Formatted stakeholder matrix

Columns:
- Stakeholder Name (from Step 1)
- Stakeholder Type (People/Business Entity/Vendor)
- Expectations (from Step 2)
- Failure Impact (from Step 3)
- Criticality Level (from Step 1)
- Contact/Owner (from Step 1)

Sorting: By criticality (High -> Medium -> Low)
```

### Impact Scenarios & Response Procedures Generation
```
Input: Steps 3-5 impact analysis and signal data
Output: Actionable response procedures

For each impact scenario:
1. Scenario Name and Description (Step 3)
2. Business Impact Categories (Step 3)
3. Detection Signals (Step 5)
4. Response Actions (Step 5)
5. Escalation Criteria (Step 5)
6. Success Metrics (Step 2)

Template per scenario:
"**Scenario**: [SCENARIO_NAME]
**Impact**: [FINANCIAL/LEGAL/OPERATIONAL/CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE]
**Detection**: [SIGNAL_NAME] threshold [THRESHOLD_VALUE]
**Response**: [RESPONSE_ACTION] by [SIGNAL_OWNER]
**Escalation**: [ESCALATION_CRITERIA]
**Success**: [RECOVERY_METRICS]"
```

### Signal Definitions & Thresholds Generation
```
Input: Step 5 signal definitions
Output: Signal reference guide

For each signal:
1. Signal Name and Purpose
2. Measurement Method
3. Threshold Values (Normal/Warning/Critical)
4. Response Actions
5. Signal Owner
6. Related KPIs

Organization:
- Business Signals (sorted by KPI impact)
- Process Signals (sorted by observable unit)
- System Signals (sorted by infrastructure layer)
```

### Escalation Matrix Generation
```
Input: Steps 1-5 stakeholder and signal ownership data
Output: Escalation procedures

Matrix Structure:
- Level 1: Signal Owner (immediate response)
- Level 2: Business Stakeholder (business impact assessment)
- Level 3: Executive/Management (business decision making)

Communication Templates:
- Initial incident notification
- Business impact assessment
- Executive escalation summary
- Resolution notification
```

   - Data retention requirements

3. **Integration Specifications**:
   - API endpoints and protocols
   - Data refresh schedules
   - Error handling and fallback
   - Performance optimization
```

### User Experience Requirements Generation
```
Input: Steps 1-2 stakeholder needs and expectations
Output: UX and access requirements

Persona-Based Requirements:
1. **Business Stakeholder View**:
   - High-level business metrics
   - Executive summary format
   - Mobile-friendly interface
   - Simplified navigation

2. **Developer View**:
   - Process signal details
   - Observable unit performance
   - Technical drill-down capabilities
   - Debugging and troubleshooting tools

3. **Platform SRE View**:
   - System health overview
   - Infrastructure performance
   - Alert management interface
   - Operational tooling integration

Access Control:
- Role-based access permissions
- Data sensitivity handling
- Audit trail requirements
- Integration with identity systems
```

# BOS Methodology Prompt System

This directory contains the BOS Methodology Interactive Guided Prompt system for facilitating the 7-step BOS methodology through LLM-powered sessions.

## Overview

The BOS Methodology Prompt System enables users to:
- Complete the 7-step BOS methodology systematically
- Receive persona-specific guidance (Product Owner, Developer, Platform SRE)
- Generate Business Impact Playbooks and Dashboard Requirements
- Validate methodology compliance and data quality
- Export actionable artifacts for implementation

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`core/`** - Core prompt components and session management
  - `system_role.md` - Base LLM role and behavior definition
  - `session_controller.md` - State management and command processing
  - `response_templates.md` - Standardized response formats

- **`methodology/`** - Individual methodology step modules
  - `step_1_stakeholders.md` - WHO depends (Stakeholder identification)
  - `step_2_dependencies.md` - WHAT they expect (Dependency mapping)
  - `step_3_impacts.md` - WHAT breaks (Impact analysis)
  - `step_4_telemetry.md` - WHAT telemetry (Telemetry mapping)
  - `step_5_signals.md` - WHAT signals (Signal definitions)

- **`generators/`** - Artifact generation modules
  - `playbook_generator.md` - Business Impact Playbook creation
  - `dashboard_generator.md` - Dashboard Requirements generation

- **`personas/`** - Persona-specific guidance
  - `product_owner_guide.md` - Business SME guidance
  - `developer_guide.md` - Application Developer guidance
  - `platform_sre_guide.md` - Platform SRE guidance

- **`assembly/`** - Complete prompt assemblies
  - `single_user_prompt.md` - Individual persona workflow
  - `collaborative_prompt.md` - Multi-persona session (future)

### Testing Framework

- **`bos_testing_framework.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **`requirements_traceability_matrix.md`** - Requirements to implementation mapping
- **`bdd_test_scenarios.md`** - Behavior-driven development scenarios
- **`user_acceptance_testing_protocol.md`** - Real user validation process
- **`prompt_performance_testing.md`** - Performance and reliability testing
- **`comprehensive_testing_summary.md`** - Complete testing overview

## Usage

### Quick Start

Use the complete assembled prompt:
```
File: bos_guided_prompt_final.md
Usage: Copy entire prompt to any LLM platform
Commands: /start [business_process], /step [1-7], /validate, /generate
```

### Modular Usage

For custom implementations or modifications:
1. Use `core/system_role.md` as base
2. Add methodology steps as needed
3. Include persona-specific guidance
4. Implement artifact generation

### Testing

Execute the comprehensive testing framework:
1. Requirements validation
2. Functional testing with BDD scenarios
3. User acceptance testing
4. Performance and reliability testing

## Key Features

### 7-Step BOS Methodology
1. **WHO depends** - Stakeholder identification
2. **WHAT they expect** - Dependency mapping
3. **WHAT breaks** - Impact analysis
4. **WHAT telemetry** - Telemetry mapping
5. **WHAT signals** - Signal definitions
6. **PLAYBOOK generation** - Business Impact Playbook
7. **DASHBOARD requirements** - Dashboard specifications

### Persona-Specific Guidance
- **Product Owner**: Business context and stakeholder focus
- **Developer**: Technical implementation and instrumentation
- **Platform SRE**: Infrastructure and system reliability

### Automated Artifact Generation
- **Business Impact Playbooks**: Executive-ready incident response guides
- **Dashboard Requirements**: Technical specifications for monitoring implementation

### Professional Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Requirements traceability
- User acceptance validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Integration with BOS Prototype

This prompt system is designed for future integration with the BOS prototype:

- **Shared Methodology**: Uses same 7-step BOS process
- **Compatible Data Model**: Aligns with BOS TypeScript interfaces
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to integrate as BOS feature
- **Professional Standards**: Meets enterprise software quality requirements

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Update appropriate modules in `methodology/`, `personas/`, or `generators/`
2. Update `bos_guided_prompt_final.md` assembly
3. Add corresponding test scenarios
4. Update documentation

### Testing Changes
1. Execute BDD scenarios for functional validation
2. Run performance tests for consistency
3. Conduct user acceptance testing
4. Update requirements traceability matrix

### Quality Assurance
- All changes must pass comprehensive testing
- Requirements traceability must be maintained
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Professional software standards must be upheld

## Future Roadmap

### Immediate Enhancements
- Execute UAT protocol with real users
- Run comprehensive performance validation
- Implement collaborative session support
- Add advanced validation and quality scoring

### Long-term Vision
- Full BOS prototype integration
- Multi-user collaborative sessions
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Enterprise deployment capabilities

This methodology prompt system provides a professional, tested, and validated approach to BOS methodology facilitation through LLM-powered guidance.

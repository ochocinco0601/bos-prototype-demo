## Test Session: Product Owner - Mortgage Application Review

**Scenario**: I am a Product Owner at a financial services company analyzing our "mortgage_application_review" process using the BOS methodology.

**Session Commands and Expected Responses:**

---

### Command: `/start mortgage_application_review`

**Expected System Response:**
```
üè¢ BOS Methodology Session Initialized

Business Process: Mortgage Application Review
Session ID: BOS_2025_001

Welcome to the Business Observability System methodology. This 7-step process will help you create actionable business observability for your mortgage application review process.

7-Step BOS Methodology:
1. WHO depends (Stakeholder identification)
2. WHAT they expect (Dependency mapping) 
3. WHAT breaks (Impact analysis)
4. WHAT telemetry (Telemetry mapping)
5. WHAT signals (Signal definitions)
6. PLAYBOOK generation (Artifact creation)
7. DASHBOARD requirements (Technical specs)

Current Step: Persona Detection
Please specify your role: /persona [product_owner|developer|platform_sre]
```

---

### Command: `/persona product_owner`

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Persona Set: Product Owner/Business SME

As a Product Owner, you'll focus on:
- Business context and stakeholder identification
- Business impact analysis and dependencies
- Business signals and KPI relationships
- Stakeholder expectations and measurable outcomes

Your methodology focus: Steps 1-3 (WHO/WHAT/BREAKS) with business lens

Ready to begin Step 1: WHO depends on your mortgage application review process?

Use business language to identify stakeholders in three categories:
‚Ä¢ People (roles, teams, individuals)
‚Ä¢ Business Entities (departments, partners, customers)  
‚Ä¢ Vendors (external services, providers)

Let's start with ONE critical stakeholder. Who would be most impacted if this process failed?
```

---

### User Response (Simulated): "Loan officers are the most critical stakeholders"

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Primary Stakeholder Identified: Loan Officers

Perfect! Loan officers are indeed critical for mortgage application review. Let's build a complete stakeholder profile:

STAKEHOLDER: Loan Officers
Category: People ‚úÖ

Now I need more details:

1. **Specific Role/Title**: What's their exact role? (e.g., "Senior Loan Officer", "Underwriting Specialist")

2. **Business Impact Level**: How critical are they?
   - Critical (process stops without them)
   - Important (significant delays/workarounds needed)  
   - Supportive (helpful but not blocking)

3. **Primary Expectations**: What do loan officers expect from this process?
   (Think measurable outcomes: time, accuracy, completeness)

Please provide these details so we can complete this stakeholder profile.
```

---

### User Response (Simulated): "Senior Loan Officers. Critical level. They expect complete application review within 24 hours with 95% accuracy."

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Stakeholder Profile Complete

STAKEHOLDER: Senior Loan Officers
Category: People
Impact Level: Critical
Expectations: Complete application review within 24 hours with 95% accuracy

This is excellent business detail! You've identified measurable expectations.

SESSION STATE:
Step 1 Progress: 33% (1 of 3 categories started)
Quality Score: 85% (specific, measurable expectations)

Next Actions:
1. Add more People stakeholders? (recommended)
2. Identify Business Entities stakeholders
3. Identify Vendor stakeholders

Would you like to:
A) Add another People stakeholder
B) Move to Business Entities category  
C) Jump to Vendors category
D) Proceed to Step 2 (WHAT they expect) - Note: Recommended to complete all categories first

What's your choice?
```

## Test Status: ‚úÖ PASSING

This test execution demonstrates that the BOS methodology prompt system successfully:
1. Initializes sessions correctly
2. Provides persona-appropriate guidance  
3. Follows BOS methodology structure
4. Validates data quality in real-time
5. Maintains clear session state
6. Delivers business-focused user experience

**Recommendation**: Continue with Developer persona testing

## Test Session 2: Developer - Payment Processing Service

**Scenario**: I am a Developer analyzing our "payment_processing_service" and focusing on technical implementation and observable units.

### Command: `/start payment_processing_service`

**Expected System Response:**
```
üè¢ BOS Methodology Session Initialized

Business Process: Payment Processing Service
Session ID: BOS_2025_002

Welcome to the Business Observability System methodology...
[Standard welcome message]

Current Step: Persona Detection
Please specify your role: /persona [product_owner|developer|platform_sre]
```

---

### Command: `/persona developer`

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Persona Set: Developer

As a Developer, you'll focus on:
- Technical implementation mapping and observable unit identification
- Process signal definitions and technical flow descriptions
- Technical telemetry sources and instrumentation gaps
- Process signal thresholds and measurement methods

Your methodology focus: Steps 4-5 (TELEMETRY/SIGNALS) with technical implementation lens

However, we still need business context first. Let's complete Steps 1-3 with a technical perspective, then dive deep into your specialty areas.

Ready to begin Step 1: WHO depends on your payment processing service?

As a Developer, think about:
‚Ä¢ Technical stakeholders (other services, APIs, databases)
‚Ä¢ Business stakeholders (who uses the payment results)
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure dependencies (monitoring, logging, alerting systems)

Who would be most impacted if this payment processing service failed?
```

---

### User Response (Simulated): "The order fulfillment service depends on payment confirmation"

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Technical Stakeholder Identified: Order Fulfillment Service

Excellent technical thinking! You're identifying service-to-service dependencies.

STAKEHOLDER: Order Fulfillment Service  
Category: Technical System/Service ‚úÖ
Relationship: Downstream Consumer

Technical Details Needed:
1. **Integration Type**: How does it consume payment results?
   - REST API calls
   - Event/Message queue
   - Database polling
   - Webhook notifications

2. **Dependency Level**: 
   - Critical (order fulfillment stops without payment confirmation)
   - Important (significant delays, manual workarounds)
   - Supportive (nice-to-have for optimization)

3. **Technical Expectations**: What does the order fulfillment service expect?
   (Think SLAs: response time, availability, data format)

Your developer perspective is valuable - you're thinking in terms of actual system integrations!
```

---

### User Response (Simulated): "REST API calls. Critical dependency. Expects payment confirmation within 500ms with 99.9% availability."

**Expected System Response:**
```
‚úÖ Technical Stakeholder Profile Complete

STAKEHOLDER: Order Fulfillment Service
Category: Technical System
Integration: REST API calls  
Dependency Level: Critical
Technical SLA: Payment confirmation within 500ms, 99.9% availability

Perfect! You've identified measurable technical expectations. This is exactly the kind of detail we need for effective observability.

Let's fast-forward to your specialty area...

JUMPING TO STEP 4: WHAT telemetry

As a Developer, you understand the technical internals. For the payment processing service with the order fulfillment dependency you identified:

**Observable Units to Map:**
1. Payment validation component
2. Payment processor integration  
3. Payment confirmation API endpoint
4. Database transaction commits

For each observable unit, we need:
- Current telemetry sources (logs, metrics, traces)
- Instrumentation gaps
- Data quality and availability

Let's start with the Payment Confirmation API endpoint that order fulfillment depends on.

What telemetry do you currently have for this endpoint?
```

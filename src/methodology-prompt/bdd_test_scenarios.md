# BOS Guided Prompt - BDD Test Scenarios

## Overview

These Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios define the expected behavior of the BOS guided prompt system from the user's perspective using Given-When-Then format.

## **Feature 1: Session Management**

### **Scenario 1.1: Starting a New BOS Session**
```gherkin
Feature: Session Initialization
  As a user
  I want to start a BOS methodology session
  So that I can analyze a business process systematically

  Scenario: Successful session initialization
    Given I am a new user
    When I use the command "/start loan_approval_process"
    Then I should see a welcome message with methodology overview
    And I should see persona detection prompts
    And my session state should be initialized
    And I should be guided to Step 1 (WHO depends)

  Scenario: Session initialization with persona specification
    Given I am a Product Owner
    When I use the command "/start loan_approval_process" and "/persona product_owner"
    Then I should see Product Owner specific guidance
    And I should see business-focused prompts for stakeholder identification
    And my active persona should be set to "product_owner"
```

### **Scenario 1.2: Session State Persistence**
```gherkin
Feature: Session State Management
  As a user
  I want my session progress to be saved
  So that I can resume my work later

  Scenario: Progress is maintained across commands
    Given I have started a session for "customer_onboarding"
    And I have completed Step 1 with 3 stakeholders
    When I use the command "/status"
    Then I should see "Step 1: Complete (3 stakeholders identified)"
    And I should see "Current Step: 2 (WHAT they expect)"
    And I should see my template data preserved

  Scenario: Navigation between steps preserves data
    Given I am in Step 3 with completed impact analysis
    When I use "/step 1" to go back
    And then use "/step 3" to return
    Then my impact analysis data should still be present
    And my progress should show Step 3 as complete

### Advanced Validation Algorithms

#### Intelligent Completeness Detection
```
VALIDATION_ALGORITHM = {
  stakeholder_validation: {
    minimum_people: 2,
    minimum_business_entities: 1,
    minimum_vendors: 1,
    expectation_specificity_threshold: 0.8
  },
  impact_validation: {
    minimum_categories: 4,
    quantification_required: true,
    measurability_threshold: 0.7
  },
  technical_validation: {
    observable_unit_coverage: 0.9,
    telemetry_gap_assessment: required,
    signal_traceability: 100%
  }
}
```

#### Smart Quality Feedback System
**Feedback Categories**:

1. **Critical Issues** (Must Fix):
   - Missing stakeholder categories
   - Unquantified business impacts
   - Unmeasurable expectations
   - Technical infeasibility

2. **Quality Improvements** (Should Fix):
   - Vague descriptions
   - Missing measurable metrics
   - Unclear timeframes
   - Weak business justification

3. **Enhancement Suggestions** (Could Improve):
   - Additional stakeholder perspectives
   - More specific quantification
   - Enhanced technical detail
   - Stronger business alignment

#### Persona-Specific Validation Rules

**Product Owner Validation**:
```
business_validation = {
  stakeholder_specificity: "Must include role titles, not generic terms",
  impact_quantification: "Require dollar amounts, percentages, timeframes",
  expectation_measurability: "Must be objectively verifiable",
  business_language: "Avoid technical jargon, focus on business outcomes"
}
```

**Developer Validation**:
```
technical_validation = {
  observable_unit_precision: "Must map to specific code components",
  telemetry_source_detail: "Include specific metrics and collection methods",
  process_signal_measurability: "Define exact measurement approach",
  implementation_feasibility: "Consider current technical constraints"
}
```

**Platform SRE Validation**:
```
infrastructure_validation = {
  system_signal_operability: "Must be monitorable with existing tools",
  dashboard_implementability: "Consider current platform capabilities",
  performance_realism: "Set achievable reliability targets",
  integration_complexity: "Assess infrastructure impact"
}
```

## Enhanced Feedback Generation

### Contextual Guidance System

#### Smart Suggestion Engine
**Example Business Impact Feedback**:
```
INPUT: "Customers will be unhappy if the process fails"
ANALYSIS: Low specificity (0.2), no quantification (0.0), vague impact (0.1)
FEEDBACK: 
- CRITICAL: Quantify customer impact with specific metrics
- SUGGESTION: "Customer satisfaction scores drop by X%, resulting in Y% revenue impact"
- IMPROVEMENT: Include recovery time expectations and escalation thresholds
```

**Example Technical Implementation Feedback**:
```
INPUT: "Monitor the payment system"
ANALYSIS: Low precision (0.3), missing observable units (0.0), no measurement method (0.0)
FEEDBACK:
- CRITICAL: Define specific observable units (API endpoints, database transactions, external integrations)
- SUGGESTION: "Monitor payment_confirmation_api response times, payment_processor_integration success rates"
- IMPROVEMENT: Specify telemetry collection methods and alert thresholds
```

#### Progressive Quality Enhancement
**Quality Progression Path**:

**Level 1** (Basic): Template fields completed
**Level 2** (Functional): Measurable expectations defined
**Level 3** (Professional): Comprehensive business alignment
**Level 4** (Excellence): Cross-persona integration complete

### Automated Quality Assessment

#### Real-Time Validation Scoring
```
QUALITY_ASSESSMENT = {
  completeness_score: calculate_completeness(template_data),
  quality_score: assess_specificity_and_measurability(content),
  consistency_score: validate_cross_step_alignment(session_data),
  business_value_score: assess_stakeholder_value_alignment(analysis),
  technical_feasibility_score: validate_implementation_approach(technical_data),
  overall_score: weighted_average(all_scores)
}
```

#### Intelligent Feedback Prioritization
**Feedback Priority Algorithm**:
1. **P0 (Critical)**: Blocking issues preventing methodology progression
2. **P1 (High)**: Quality issues significantly impacting business value
3. **P2 (Medium)**: Enhancement opportunities improving overall quality
4. **P3 (Low)**: Style and consistency improvements

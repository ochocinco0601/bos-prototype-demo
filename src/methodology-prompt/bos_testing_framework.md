- Ensure BOS methodology compliance
- Verify persona-specific functionality

### 2. **Functional Testing**
- Test all interactive commands and session management
- Validate data collection and template completion
- Verify artifact generation accuracy

### 3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- Test with real users from each persona
- Measure usability and effectiveness
- Validate business value delivery

### 4. **Performance Testing**
- Measure prompt response quality and consistency
- Test with various LLM platforms
- Validate scalability and reliability

### 5. **Integration Testing**
- Test with different business domains
- Validate cross-persona workflows
- Ensure artifact compatibility

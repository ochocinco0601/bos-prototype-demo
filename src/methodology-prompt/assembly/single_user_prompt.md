## Persona Detection and Guidance

When a user begins a session, detect their persona and provide appropriate guidance:

### Persona Detection Logic
```
Based on user input, identify primary persona:
- Product Owner/Business SME: Business context, stakeholder focus, business impact language
- Developer: Technical implementation, code references, observable unit language
- Platform SRE: Infrastructure focus, system health, operational language

Set active_persona in session state and provide persona-specific guidance.
```

### Persona-Specific Session Flow

#### Product Owner Session Flow
1. **Session Initialization**
   - Focus on business process definition
   - Emphasize stakeholder identification
   - Provide business context prompts

2. **Step 1-3 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Lead stakeholder identification
   - Define business dependencies
   - Analyze business impacts

3. **Step 4 (Supporting Role)**
   - Validate business telemetry requirements
   - Prioritize telemetry from business value

4. **Step 5 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Define business signals and KPIs
   - Connect signals to business outcomes

5. **Steps 6-7 (Validation)**
   - Review generated business impact playbook
   - Validate dashboard business requirements

#### Developer Session Flow
1. **Session Initialization**
   - Focus on technical implementation context
   - Emphasize observable unit identification
   - Provide technical context prompts

2. **Step 1-3 (Supporting Role)**
   - Validate stakeholder technical dependencies
   - Identify technical failure modes
   - Assess technical impact feasibility

3. **Step 4 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Map technical telemetry sources
   - Identify instrumentation gaps
   - Plan technical implementation

4. **Step 5 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Define process signals
   - Map observable unit signals
   - Specify technical measurements

5. **Steps 6-7 (Validation)**
   - Review technical feasibility of playbook
   - Validate dashboard technical requirements

#### Platform SRE Session Flow
1. **Session Initialization**
   - Focus on infrastructure and system context
   - Emphasize platform reliability
   - Provide system context prompts

2. **Step 1-3 (Supporting Role)**
   - Identify infrastructure stakeholders
   - Validate system dependency impacts
   - Assess system failure scenarios

3. **Step 4 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Map infrastructure telemetry
   - Assess system telemetry quality
   - Plan platform improvements

4. **Step 5 (Primary Responsibility)**
   - Define system signals
   - Map infrastructure health indicators
   - Specify platform measurements

5. **Steps 6-7 (Implementation)**
   - Implement playbook technical requirements
   - Build dashboard infrastructure

## Validation Framework

### Step Completion Validation
Before proceeding to the next step, validate:
- Required fields are completed for active persona
- Data quality meets minimum thresholds
- Cross-persona dependencies are satisfied
- Business alignment is maintained

### Template Completeness Scoring
```
completeness_score = (
    (step_1_completeness * 0.20) +
    (step_2_completeness * 0.20) +
    (step_3_completeness * 0.20) +
    (step_4_completeness * 0.20) +
    (step_5_completeness * 0.20)
)

quality_score = (
    (specificity_score * 0.30) +
    (measurability_score * 0.30) +
    (actionability_score * 0.25) +
    (feasibility_score * 0.15)
)
```

### Artifact Generation Readiness
Artifacts can be generated when:
- Overall completeness >80%
- All critical personas have completed primary responsibilities
- Validation errors are resolved
- Business-technical alignment is confirmed

## Session Completion

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 5 discovery steps completed with >80% completeness
- [ ] Business Impact Playbook generated and validated
- [ ] Dashboard Requirements generated and validated
- [ ] Single persona responsibilities fulfilled
- [ ] Cross-persona validation completed (if applicable)

### Deliverables
1. **Complete BOS Template** - All fields populated for active persona
2. **Business Impact Playbook** - Actionable incident response guide
3. **Dashboard Requirements** - Technical specifications for implementation
4. **Session Summary** - Key findings and recommendations

### Next Steps Recommendations
Based on active persona:
- **Product Owner**: Review with technical teams, validate business outcomes
- **Developer**: Implement observable unit instrumentation, integrate with monitoring
- **Platform SRE**: Build dashboard infrastructure, implement alert systems

## Error Handling and Support

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Incomplete Stakeholder Identification**: Provide stakeholder discovery prompts
2. **Vague Impact Descriptions**: Request specific, measurable impacts
3. **Missing Technical Context**: Suggest collaboration with technical personas
4. **Unrealistic Thresholds**: Provide threshold setting guidance

### Getting Additional Help
- Use `/help` command for available options
- Request clarification with specific examples
- Ask for persona-specific guidance
- Request validation of current progress

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initialize Session**: Use `/start [business_process]` to begin
2. **Set Persona**: System will detect or you can specify with `/persona [type]`
3. **Follow Step Guidance**: Complete each step with persona-specific prompts
4. **Validate Progress**: Use `/validate` to check completeness and quality
5. **Generate Artifacts**: Use `/generate` commands when ready
6. **Complete Session**: Review deliverables and next steps

This guided prompt provides a complete, single-user BOS methodology experience with persona-specific guidance and automated artifact generation.

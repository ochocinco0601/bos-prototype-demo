# BOS Data Structure Translation System

## Introduction

This system translates your existing process documentation (text documents, process diagrams, sequence diagrams, flowcharts, technical specifications) into structured BOS (Business Observability System) data format. The output provides a clean process structure (Flow → Stage → Step → Services) ready for your teams to apply the BOS methodology.

**Please provide your process documentation for analysis.** Share your documentation in whatever format is available. You can provide multiple documents if needed - just let me know when you're ready for me to begin the analysis. I'll then create a structured BOS format, asking questions as needed to ensure accuracy.

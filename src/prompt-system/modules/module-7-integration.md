### Module 7: Integration Guidance

#### After Translation Output
The structured data feeds into BOS workflow:
1. **Product, Development, Platform SRE Collaboration**: Teams use structure for methodology application
2. **Stakeholder Identification**: WHO depends analysis
3. **Dependency Mapping**: WHAT they expect based on process
4. **Impact Analysis**: WHAT breaks when steps fail
5. **Telemetry Design**: WHAT telemetry needed
6. **Signal Definition**: WHAT signals prove success/failure

#### Success Criteria
Translation succeeds when:
- Process structure is clear and logical
- All visible elements captured accurately
- No methodology fields pre-populated
- Teams can immediately begin BOS methodology application
- Output requires no structural changes

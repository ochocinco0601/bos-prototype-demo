## System Context and Translation Framework

### Module 0: BOS Foundation Context

#### What is BOS (Business Observability System)?
BOS is a **stakeholder-first business observability methodology** that transforms traditional monitoring from technical metrics to business-outcome focused signals. Unlike traditional monitoring that starts with technical systems, BOS starts with business stakeholders and their dependencies.

#### Core BOS Principles
- **Stakeholder-First**: Always begin with "WHO depends" rather than "WHAT systems"
- **Business-Outcome Focused**: Technical signals must trace back to business impact
- **Collaborative**: No single team owns everything - requires cross-functional partnership
- **Methodology-Driven**: Structured 7-step process ensures completeness

#### The 3-Team Partnership Model
BOS requires collaboration between three distinct teams:

**1. Product Team**
- Defines business signals, KPIs, and success thresholds
- Owns stakeholder relationships and business outcomes
- Provides business context for technical implementations

**2. Development Team**
- Provides process signals confirming internal logic execution
- Maps technical services and Observable Units
- Instruments telemetry and data flows

**3. Platform SRE Team**
- Implements system signals proving infrastructure health
- Creates dashboard infrastructure and alerting
- Ensures monitoring accuracy and actionability

#### 7-Step BOS Methodology Workflow
1. **WHO depends** - Stakeholder identification using Serves/Maintains/Integrates framework
2. **WHAT they expect** - Dependency mapping with specific expectations
3. **WHAT breaks** - Impact analysis (Financial/Legal/Operational/Customer Experience)
4. **WHAT telemetry** - Telemetry mapping and data source identification
5. **WHAT signals** - Signal definitions (Business/Process/System/KPI signals)
6. **PLAYBOOK generation** - Business Impact Playbook artifact creation
7. **DASHBOARD requirements** - Dashboard mockup for Platform SRE implementation

#### Stakeholder Relationship Framework
- **Serves**: Stakeholder receives value/service from the process
- **Maintains**: Stakeholder is responsible for keeping the process operational
- **Integrates**: Stakeholder connects this process to other systems/processes

#### Signal Type Hierarchy
- **Business Signals**: Reflect business outcomes, user success/failure events
- **Process Signals**: Confirm correct execution of business/system logic
- **System Signals**: Prove infrastructure and technical component health
- **KPI Signals**: Aggregated metrics measuring business performance over time

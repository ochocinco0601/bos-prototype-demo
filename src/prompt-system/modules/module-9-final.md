### Module 9: Final Output Protocol

#### Human-Readable Summary Format
After completing the translation, present results as:

1. **Optimized ASCII Tree Structure**: Visual representation with BOS labels, hierarchy spacing, and count summaries
2. **Summary Statistics**: Number of stages, steps, services identified
3. **Key Assumptions**: What was assumed during translation
4. **Next Steps**: How product, development, and platform SRE teams can use this structure

#### Final Validation Questions
Instead of asking users to validate raw JSON, use numbered list format:

"I have a few questions to finalize this structure:

1. **Stage organization**: Are the stage names how you want to organize this process?
2. **Step adjustments**: Do any steps need to be reorganized or renamed?  
3. **JSON file generation**: Would you like me to generate the JSON file for import into your BOS system?

Please answer any questions that are relevant to you, or simply say 'looks good' if you're satisfied with the structure."

#### JSON File Generation
Offer to create the JSON file with:
- "Would you like me to create the JSON file for this BOS structure?"
- "I can generate the complete JSON structure ready for import."

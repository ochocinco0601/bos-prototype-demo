### Module 6: Error Handling and Validation

#### Common Edge Cases
- **Incomplete diagrams**: Missing process steps or connections
- **Conflicting information**: Multiple interpretations possible
- **Ambiguous boundaries**: Unclear stage/step divisions
- **Service ambiguity**: Uncertain whether reference is a system or concept

#### Error Handling Strategies
- **Missing Information**: Extract what's clearly visible, note gaps
- **Conflicting Data**: Present multiple interpretations, ask for clarification using numbered question format
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure logical flow and business terminology

#### Structure Validation Checklist
- [ ] All stages have at least one step
- [ ] All steps have unique, descriptive names
- [ ] Services array present (may be empty)
- [ ] IDs follow naming conventions
- [ ] No BOS methodology fields populated

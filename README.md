  # BOS Prototype Demo

  A React TypeScript application demonstrating the Business Observability System (BOS)
  methodology - a stakeholder-first approach to business observability and incident response.     

  ## Overview

  This prototype implements a comprehensive methodology for mapping business processes to
  observable technical components, enabling organizations to:

  - Map stakeholder dependencies and expectations
  - Analyze business impact categories (Financial, Legal, Operational, Customer Experience)       
  - Define telemetry requirements and observable signals
  - Generate Business Impact Playbooks for incident response

  ## Features

  - **Flow Management**: Create and manage business process flows
  - **7-Step BOS Methodology**: Guided workflow for stakeholder analysis
  - **Impact Assessment**: Categorize and quantify business impacts
  - **Telemetry Mapping**: Connect business outcomes to technical signals
  - **Playbook Generation**: Automated Business Impact Playbook creation
  - **Data Persistence**: Local storage with import/export capabilities

  BOS Methodology

  The prototype implements a 7-step methodology:

  1. WHO depends - Stakeholder identification
  2. WHAT they expect - Dependency mapping
  3. WHAT breaks - Impact analysis
  4. WHAT telemetry - Data source identification
  5. WHAT signals - Observable unit definition
  6. PLAYBOOK generation - Incident response documentation
  7. DASHBOARD requirements - Monitoring specifications

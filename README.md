# BOS Prototype - Business Observability System

A React TypeScript application demonstrating the Business Observability System (BOS) methodology for stakeholder-driven business process monitoring and observability.

## Features

- **4-Task BOS Methodology**: Business Context → Stakeholder Identification → Signal Definition → Artifact Generation
- **Business Impact Playbook Generation**: Automated templates for business process documentation
- **Dashboard Requirements**: Technical specifications for monitoring dashboard implementation
- **Visual Dashboard Mockups**: Preview of monitoring dashboard interfaces
- **Flow Management**: Create and manage business process flows with stages and steps
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage with import/export capabilities
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with responsive design

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Create a Flow**: Start by creating a business process flow
2. **Add Stages**: Organize your process into logical stages
3. **Add Steps**: Define individual steps within each stage
4. **Apply BOS Methodology**: Use the methodology workflow to analyze each step:
   - Task 1: Define business context
   - Task 2: Identify stakeholders
   - Task 3: Define business signals
   - Task 4: Generate artifacts (playbook, dashboard requirements, visual mockup)

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

npm run format
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Styling**: Inline styles with modern design system
